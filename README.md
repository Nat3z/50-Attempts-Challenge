# 50 Attempts Challenge
Website and Javascript by [NatiaDev](https://github.com/Nat3z), original challenge idea by [Eric Van Wilderman](https://www.youtube.com/c/EricVanWilderman)

# What is the 50 Attempts Challenge?
To make this short, you have 50 attempts to beat as many recent levels as possible.

# What does this website do?
This website makes this process of getting recent levels easier by grabbing the most recent levels thru the [GD Browser API](https://gdbrowser.com/) and displaying it in a readable fasion. Not only that, it also displays the amount of remaining attempts you have left and will do the appropriate calculations when you submit a completed level.

# Contributions/Software Used
- [GD Browser API - GD Colon](https://gdbrowser.com/)
